# PasswordStrengthChecker
The provided JavaScript code functions as a password strength checker and a password visibility toggle. This code offers real-time feedback to users on the strength of their passwords based on specific criteria. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Initialization**
The code initializes an object named parameters that tracks whether the password meets four specific criteria:

The password length exceeds seven characters.
The password includes at least one letter.
The password contains at least one numeric digit.
The password includes at least one special character.
Additionally, it initializes two DOM elements:

**strengthBar**: An element that visually represents the password strength.
**msg**: An element that displays a message regarding the password strength.
2. **Strength Checker Function**
The main function, strengthChecker, performs the following tasks:

Retrieves the current password input by the user.
Updates the parameters object based on whether the password meets the defined criteria.
Calculates the number of criteria met by the password.
Updates the strengthBar element to visually represent the password strength by adding a number of spans proportional to the number of criteria met.
Colors the spans and updates the msg element to provide a message that corresponds to the password strength, categorized as very weak, weak, good, or strong.
3. **Password Visibility Toggle**
The toggle function allows users to switch the visibility of their password between hidden (password) and visible (text) states. It changes the color of an icon to indicate the current visibility state:

When the password is hidden, the icon color is gray.
When the password is visible, the icon color changes to green.
This functionality is useful for users who want to verify their password entries without the risk of typing errors.
